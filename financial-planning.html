          One of the key objectives of a financial plan is to educate
          individuals towards their financial capacity and risk appetite.
          Assessment of household income, expenses and age is the first step
          towards devising a financial plan. A key aspect of the financial plan
          involves assessing risk appetite (conservative, moderate, or
          aggressive) of an individual which is nothing but deciding upon
          allocation of savings into equity, debt and cash instruments. One
          should never think of devising a financial plan without professional
          help of a SEBI certified Registered Investment Advisor (RIA). The
          financial advisor not only helps in identifying SMART** financial
          goals but also helps in identifying the target amount required for
          each of the goals like:

          Max and Sam graduated together and were placed in a same company with
          same packages. Both wanted to retire at the age of 40 and live rest of
          their lives in countryside. Max without assessing his assets, goals
          and liabilities started saving without creating a proper plan. On
          other hand, Sam hired certified financial advisor. Sam calculated his
          assets, identified expenditure including wedding, family planning,
          childrenâ€™s education and retirement. Sam tracked and implemented his
          financial action plan.
        </p>
        <p>
          Max, at 35, realized that his unorganized lifestyle left limited money
          to retire at age of 40. Because of his unorganized lifestyle Max was
          unable to collect enough corpus required for his early retirement. Max
          was forced to work even after 40.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sam used systematic approach and identified his SMART goals. He
          properly implemented and monitored his financial action plan time to
          time. He was able to achieve all his goals timely and had enough money
          to retire at 40 and live his desired life.
